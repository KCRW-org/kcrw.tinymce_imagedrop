======================
kcrw.tinymce_imagedrop
======================

``kcrw.tinymce_imagedrop`` is a Plone add-on which allows users to drag and drop images into TinyMCE 4.
Dropping images will automatically create Image content in the Plone site and render them in
the WYSIWYG using UID references.

This add-on supports Plone 5.x and Plone 4.3 (with TinyMCE 4 enabled via ``plone.app.widgets``).

Features
--------

- Provides a Javascript Plugin for TinyMCE which handles uploading images via a browser view
- Provides a Plone browser view ``@@create-dropped-images`` which creates Image content in the nearest container allowed.
- The view can be overriden to customize the image type, the image creation location, or the markup used for the images.

Installation
------------

Install kcrw.tinymce_imagedrop by adding it to your buildout::

    [buildout]

    ...

    eggs =
        kcrw.tinymce_imagedrop


and then running ``bin/buildout``. On Plone 5+ you must install the add-on from the Add-ons control panel,
on Plone 4.3 (with ``plone.app.widgets``) it will be enabled automatically via a monkey patch when added
to your buildout.
